# Tutors4Zoomers
Our application is a portal for users to connect with volunteer tutors or students. We want to inspire our communities to volunteer their time to help students in need during COVID-19. Our application features tutor registration, booking lessons, collaborative whiteboarding, and online communication via video and/or text messaging.
